# Arrays
# Arrays are collections of data of the same type
# In a given order

# Ex: in Python

lottery_draw = [5, 12, 3, 25, 45, 18]
student_list = ['Stewart', 'Margo', 'Kyle']

# Lists
# Lists are collections of data that can be mixed
# In a given order

various = ['Aurelien', 25, True, 45.6, 'Mike']

# There's a subtle difference in the way they're
# Represented in computer memory
# In Python unless you use a specifc array() object,
# We always use lists, albeit with a single type of
# Data most of the time

# Dictionaries
# Dictionaries are collections of values of mixed types
# attached to a number of keys. They are not ordered

teacher = {'name': 'Aurelien','age': 40,'location': 'Edinburgh' }
print(teacher['name'])
